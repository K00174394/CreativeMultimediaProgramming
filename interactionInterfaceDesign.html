                With the help of both http://www.pdfmerge.com and http://combinepdf.com, I was finally able to tackle my viewing problems. By margining my pdf into sections using pdfmerge and then combining them altogether using combine pdf, I was finally able to upload my portfolio to Issuu.

               After completion of my CV, I have began to plan out my portfolio. Before I began to add content I decided on my colour scheme and font. I have decided to keep the theme of my CV and incorporate it into my portfolio. The colour scheme I have chosen is:
                    
                    
               <div class="image">
                <img src="img/colourscheme.png" alt="Interaction Interface Colour Scheme"/>
                </div>
                </div>

                <div class="text">
I will primarily use the two pink colours for my portfolio.

The next decision I made is the font for my portfolio. Again, I have to decided to keep my cv design consistent with my portfolio and have decided to use the font Delihi previously used within my Curriculum Vitae. I have downloaded this font from dafont.com and have installed into both Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.

                <div class="text">
                
                My next step was to decide on what content I will include in my portfolio. I will include a table of contents, my cv and my projects. I have decided to include projects I have completed last semester and projects I have completed from my previous course over the last four years.

Upon research of various portfolios, many people add a mood-board to describe themselves within their portfolio. Im still making a decision to add a mood-board to my portfolio to add a sense of personalisation and portray my personality to potential employers.

As I have decided on my overall colour scheme, font, and potential content I will begin to design my portfolio using the Adobe suite.

                  After careful research of various portfolios and CV's, my step was to develop my own excellent designed CV. To do this, I used various examples I have researched to customise to my own preference.

Before I began, I decided on a colour scheme that I plan to use in relation to my cv and portfolio. I then decided on what fonts I would like to use and finally I decided on my skills and information I need to display on my CV.

                  <div class="text">

                      <b>Colours</b><br/>
The colour scheme I have chosen is a palette that contains, pinks, blue's, yellows and browns. I found this palette from <a href="colourlovers.com">colourlovers.com</a>

                      <b>Why Pink?</b><br/>
Overall, I plan to use the two shades of pink primarily for my cv and incorporate the various other colours into my portfolio. Pink is a combination of the colours red and white. Pink contains the need for action of red, helping to achieve potential success. With this CV I hope to successfully secure a job within the sector of Information Technology.

The next decision was the fonts I would use on my CV. I decided on two fonts. These fonts are Delhi regular and Segoe UI Light.
