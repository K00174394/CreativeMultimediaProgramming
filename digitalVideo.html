               <h3>The main objective of our first assignment was to portray a location. As a group we decided on Limerick Animal Welfare. Limerick Animal Welfare is a rescue and rehoming facility for all types of animals including: Dogs,
		       Cats, Rabbits, Horses.</h3>
                    </div>

                <div class="text">
                <p>The sanctuary works with a '<i>no-kill policy</i>'. 
			All animals at the sanctuary are cared for until they are found a suitable home.

                Once we decided on our location, we planned what would be involved in:
			Pre-production, Production, Post-production</p>
                </div>

                <div class="text">
                <h3>Pre-Production</h3>
                   <p> Pre-production is the work carried out before full production begins.
			   In this area of production each group member was assigned a role. Roles included: 
			   Director (Lorraine), Producer (Shannon), Camera operator (Clodagh), Sound director (Joana)</p>
                </div>
                
            <div class="text">
                <p>Once a role was assigned to each group member we carried out research on our chosen location. 
			We used online sources to do this. With the use of the Limerick Animal Welfare's website 
			and social media, we were able to have a better understanding of the area before we 
			arrived on-site. Before we visited the location, Director Lorraine, rang Limerick
			Animal Welfare to confirm we could use their location and film.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="text">
                   <p> After research, we decided on the project concept. The project concept was to raise 
			   awareness of the location so more people would become familiar with the area and maybe 
			   able to volunteer in the sanctuary or adopt an animal. We also discussed what type of 
			   shots we learned about and which would be more suitable to use on the day.</p>
                </div>
                
        <div class="text">
          <p>  For this assignment, I was assigned the role of producer. With my role as producer it was my duty 
		  to ensure that all equipment was up to standards, charged and taken out from the college's help desk
		  before production began.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text">                
            <p>The equipment need for this assignment was: Camera, Tripod, Battery, Lenses ,Charger, iPhone for 
		    scouting purposes</p>
        </div>
                
    <div class="text">                  
        <p>As Clodagh owns the majority of this equipment, all that was borrowed from the help-desk was a tripod. 
		To use the college equipment I had to sign out the tripod using my Knumber and course name and was 
		given a date for its return. </p>
    </div>

     <h3>Production</h3>
<p>Production is known as 'the action of processing shots to create a video or film'. On Wednesday, 28th of September, 
	Clodagh, Lorraine and I went to visit the location. Unfortunately, Joana could not make it that day due to 
	family reasons.</p>
</div>
                
 <div class="text">                 
<p>On arrival, we met the manger of the sanctuary, Maire. Maire allowed us to scope the location out before we began production of the video. During scouting we visited the dog, cat and horse areas. We viewed: 
The kennels in which the animals are kept their facilities, Food areas, Vet area, Washing area
Upon scoping these areas we met a volunteer member of Limerick Animal Welfare named Winnie. Winnie offered us 
	a tour of the location and provided us with lots of information of the sanctuary. During this tour, 
	it provided us with an excellent opportunity to scope every aspect of the location and allowed me as 
	producer to capture images I thought would make excellent shots to portray the locations. </p>
                </div>
                
 <div class="text">                 
<p>When the tour was over, Camera Operator began to capture shots of outside area. The outside shots enclosed: 
	The location Entrance, Limerick Animal Welfares logo, Outside Kennels, Various other outside areas
     
While we moved to the inside areas of the location, Clodagh offered us all the opportunity for each of to use the camera and capture shots. She explained to us how to: Use the camera, Moving the camera using the tripod, Panning, Tilting, Beginning and stopping a shot.
We spent approximately 4 hours capturing shots at Limerick Animal Welfare. Upon capturing our last shot the 
	battery in the camera died. We were just able to capture our final shot.</p>

  <div class="text">                
      <h3>Post-Production</h3>
<p>Post-production is known as the 'making of motion pictures'. During the week of October 3rd, the group met up to 
	discus the production phase. As Joana was unable to attend the production phase we offered her an overview of 
	the day. We then sat down as a group and examined our shots. As director, Lorraine picked what shots she thought 
	would be more beneficial to portray our project concept. </p>
                </div>
      

<div class="text">    
<p>On the 4th and 5th of October we began putting the shots together. To do this, we used Premiere Pro. 
	As producer it was my responsibly to put the shots together. Each group member discussed the shot sequence 
	and transitions. As I was not completely familiar with Premiere Pro, Clodagh offered her help as she has 
	experience using the software. Each member of the group had the opportunity to test out the software.</p>
          </div>

 <div class="text">              
<p>Once the shots were put together with transitions, Music Director Joana chose various songs that she deemed 
	suitable for the video. We listened to each song together and as a group voted which song enabled us to 
	capture our location concept. Once editing was complete, we exported the file and uploaded the video to Vimeo.
	Overall the post-production stage took us approximately 3-4 days. </p>
