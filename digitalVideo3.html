              <p> The first thing our group did was sit down as a group and discuss our new roles. For the last assignment it was duty to be the Director.

The roles are as follows: As I am director, I will be working close with both other people to ensure that the aims of the assignment are met. The assignment includes a scripted dialogue. This dialogue will be recorded by our producer Clodagh.


As a group we have decided we will begin recording footage on Wednesday 23rd. The equipment we recorded was a camera and a SD card. Clodagh supplied her camera and SD card to record the footage.

<p>To begin, we sat down as a group and viewed videos of Limerick Institute of Technology and promotional video's of the college. Each of us made a list of video's we thought would be most relevant for the assignment. Then we cut down the list to the video's we actually would use. That evening I dowloaded the video's from Youtube and Vimeo and began to trim the video's to the various shots we would use. I then made a shot list of what sequence I thought was most suitable for the clips. 

The next stage was capturing our own footage. We decided we would record within the gym and the canteen. Unfortunately, this footage did not come out well as we recored during the afternoon and not many students were around the campus. As a group, we thought it was a good idea to schedule shooting. Instead, we recorded on the college's 'Christmas Day'.  This was a good day to get footage as the college had many people around the campus. On this day, Lorraine also shot footage of the Science Departments labs and the woodwork labs.

The next step was editing. This did not go to plan as the footage Lorraine recording was far too big and caused the computer to crash. As we had a lot of assignments and exams underway, the group thought it was best to leave this assignment till the end of the exams.

                On Friday last, we began editing and set out the footage that we had taken and also the videos we had chosen to use. Again, there was problem with the footage as it was too large so we were unable to bring the shots of the LIT Christmas Day into the video.
