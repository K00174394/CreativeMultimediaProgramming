                Atspace is an unlimited free web hosting with email sending enable and automatic script installer. It also includes a MySQL Database which is exactly the same as my local database PhpMyAdmin.
                    
                I plan to deploy my web application using atSpace. I have decided to make my account now to secure my domain name. My domain name is: agileageing.atspace.eu.

                In the past week I have added a relationships to my tables for my web application. With these relationships it will allow me retrieve and insert data into multiple table through one insert command in my web application.

                <div class="text">
Adding relationships to SQL tables is important because:
It helps to further refine table structures and minimize redundant data
It enables you to draw data from multiple tables simultaneously

                  This weekend I have successfully integrated help pop up boxes into my web application. These pop up boxes when toggled over will provide the user with information on signing up, the home page, games page, contact page and score page. I have also coded back buttons to my quiz answer pages. These back buttons redirect you back to the previous page you were looking at in correlation to your web history.

                      As my front end is complete, from now on I plan to give my database relationships and then begin coding the back end of my project including: user login, user sign up, a time for a memory game and the score board to keep track of the users scores.

                 So far this week, I have developed 4 web pages that display the correct answer to the quizzes. The user can only access these pages if they are logged into the application and have completed the quiz. Also this weekend, I plan to incorporate the help-boxes into my code before I begin to add relationships to my database to begin the coding aspect to my project.
