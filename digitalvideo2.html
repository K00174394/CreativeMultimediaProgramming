              For the second assignment as part of our Digital Video course, we had to produce a video based on moving one or more people through space. As the video is moving people through space it must include a narrative story. A narrative story must contain a beginning, middle and a conclusion to the story. 

                    </div>

                <div class="text">
                Upon discussion, we decided to go with a chase or follow sequence involving two people moving through space. A chase/follow sequence centers on a pursuit in a certain location.
                </div>

                <div class="text">
                Because of this options we had to focus on various aspects while shooting. These aspects included: Change of scene direction, Music, Location, Pacing in the frame, Point of view of chaser or the person being chased
                </div>
                
            <div class="text">
                Once we discussed which option we were going to take, we decided on our roles for this assignment and what story we would portray. Firstly, we decided I would be Director but due to circumstances each of us had to change role for this assignment.
                </div>

            <div class="text">
                Because of this our roles were: Director - Clodagh, Producer/Chase Victim - Lorraine, Camera Operator/ Sound Operator - Shannon. Once our roles were distributed we decided on our plot. Our plot included a chase of a person (Lorraine) being followed by a clown toy. With this plot in mind we began to develop storyboards for our plot. 
                </div>
                
        <div class="text">
            As camera operator for this assignment I worked closely with the director, Clodagh. Clodagh and I both took turns using the camera as she has more experience with the camera and provided me with knowledge on how to achieve the best scenes.

        <div class="text">                
            To modify this audio, we used what is known as a wild track. A wild track is an audio recording intended to be synchronized with video but recorded separately from the shots.
                </div>


        
                
    <div class="text">                  
        Overall, the whole process of the assignment went very well from start to end. As a group we enjoyed the switch in roles in comparison to the first assignment and became more knowledgeable with how the camera works, editing software and the structure of how scenes are shot.
