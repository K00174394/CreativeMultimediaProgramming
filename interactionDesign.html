    Interaction design, often abbreviated as IxD, is "the practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services.":xxxi,1 While the digital side of this statement is true, interaction design is also useful when creating physical (non-digital) products, exploring how a user might interact with it. Common topics of interaction design include design, humanâ€“computer interaction, and software development. While interaction design has an interest in form (similar to other design fields), its main area of focus rests on behavior.:1 Rather than analyzing how things are, interaction design synthesizes and imagines things as they could be. This element of interaction design is what clearly marks IxD as a design field as opposed to a science or engineering field
