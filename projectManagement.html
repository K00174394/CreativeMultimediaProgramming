                 <div class="text">
                A project is temporary in that it has a defined beginning and end in time, and therefore defined scope and resources.
                    </div>  
<div class="text">
And a project is unique in that it is not a routine operation, but a specific set of operations designed to accomplish a singular goal. So a project team often includes people who don’t usually work together – sometimes from different organizations and across multiple geographies.
                </div>
                
                
<div class="text">
The development of software for an improved business process, the construction of a building or bridge, the relief effort after a natural disaster, the expansion of sales into a new geographic market — all are projects.
                </div>    
<div class="text">
And all must be expertly managed to deliver the on-time, on-budget results, learning and integration that organizations need.
                </div>
<div class="text">                
Project management, then, is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.
