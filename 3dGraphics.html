                <h2>Creative Multimedia Programming: Introduction to 3D Graphics</h2>
                    </div>
                <div class="text">
                <h3>Three-dimensional computer graphics (3D computer graphics, in contrast to 2D computer graphics) are graphics that use a 
			three-dimensional representation of geometric data (often Cartesian) that is stored in the computer for the 
			purposes of performing calculations and rendering 2D images. Such images may be stored for 
			viewing later or displayed in real-time.</h3>
                    </div>

                <div class="text">
                <p>3D computer graphics rely on many of the same algorithms as 2D computer vector graphics in the 
			wire-frame model and 2D computer raster graphics in the final rendered display. In computer 
			graphics software, the distinction between 2D and 3D is occasionally blurred; 2D applications 
			may use 3D techniques to achieve effects such as lighting, and 3D may use 2D rendering techniques.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="text">
                <p>3D computer graphics are often referred to as 3D models. Apart from the rendered graphic, 
			the model is contained within the graphical data file. However, there are differences: 
			a 3D model is the mathematical representation of any three-dimensional object. A model is not 
			technically a graphic until it is displayed. A model can be displayed visually as a 
			two-dimensional image through a process called 3D rendering or used in non-graphical 
			computer simulations and calculations. With 3D printing, 3D models are similarly rendered 
			into a 3D physical representation of the model, with limitations to how accurate the rendering 
			can match the virtual model.</p>
